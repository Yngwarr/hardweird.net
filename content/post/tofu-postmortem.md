Tofu delivery game was my first 3D game made with Godot. It also was the first
ever experience of Godot 4 and I liked it!

Points to make:
* Second game where we didn't overthink theme much and just picked the first
    idea we had. Makes your life way easier.
* Didn't shy away from free assets to save us headache of learning Blender in a
    short period of time.
* Godot's car physics nodes are pretty good, despite having the most
    unreasonable defaults I've ever seen.
* Most time was spent on making a level and adjusting visual effects.
* Godot 4 is somewhat unstable, but still much better than Unity.
